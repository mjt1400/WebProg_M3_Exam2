            <h1>Autobiographical Profile</h1>
            <img src="grad-pic.jpg">
            <p>I’m an Information Systems Student, Gamer,and the Auditor of the Computing
                Students Society (2021-2022) at Malayan Colleges Mindanao. I was born at a
                very young age during August 14, 2001. I’ve been undertaking some interesting hobbies
                like learning how to code in multiple languages such as Python, Java, Dart, as well as studying data analysis and management. I’m a shy guy to strangers but I’m quite extroverted when it comes to my closest friends.

            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <p> I’ve always dreamt of becoming a Data Analyst		
                Or Software Engineer at the age of 30. 
                The thought of learning more about
                 technology fascinates me. I’m				
                also hoping to get rich as soon as possible by investing 
                in the stock market, crypto market, and real estate.			
                Aside from all of that, I also want to explore 
                the entire world. A part of me
                would love to have a bizarre adventure before I get too old.
                Right now, I’m still doing my best to fulfill my goals.
                Working hard and smart should probably help me in attaining
                what I want. I can only hope that my efforts bear the fruits I want.
