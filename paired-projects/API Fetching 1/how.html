            <p>The king's Cup is a drinking game played with cards by a group of people. Any number of players can take part as long as each player has an adequate amount of drink at their disposal.</p> <br>
        </div>
        <div class = "instruction-text">
            <p>To start the game, the player must click the 'start' button at the home page. After that, we are now ready to start! The first player must click the 'Draw Card' button. Once a card has been drawn, the face value will be shown. Each card has a rule associated with it. The rules are varied and some might require instant action of the players or a mini drinking game to be played. Enjoy the game!</p> <br>
